# MSP samples in the Galactic field and globular clusters

List of field and globular cluster MSPs (P < 20ms) and associated parameters and survey information used in Figure 1 of Liu et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12185).

The four samples are: the MSPs in Lorimer et al. (2015) [2015MNRAS.450.2185L]
and three samples created in Liu et al. The specific files are listed here:

    SampleA.mrt   MSPs in Sample A "the fiducial sample"
    SampleB.mrt   MSPs in Sample B "a list of all the radio MSPs in the Galactic field"
    SampleC.mrt   MSPs in Sample C "a list of all MSPs in globular clusters"
