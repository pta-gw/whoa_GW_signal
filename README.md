# MSP samples in the Galactic field and globular clusters

List of field and globular cluster MSPs (P < 20ms) and associated information used in Figure 1 of Liu et al ("On the spin period distribution of millisecond pulsars", https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12185).

The four samples are: the MSPs in Lorimer et al. (2015) [2015MNRAS.450.2185L]
and three samples created in Liu et al. The specific files are listed here:
    
    L15.txt       MSPs in Lorimer et al. (2015) [2015MNRAS.450.2185L]
    SampleA.txt   MSPs in Sample A "the fiducial sample"
    SampleB.txt   MSPs in Sample B "a list of all the radio MSPs in the Galactic field"
    SampleC.txt   MSPs in Sample C "a list of all MSPs in globular clusters"

A Python notebook (show_msp_samples.ipynb) is also provided for visualizing the data.
